Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel
I'll write a hundred more"
"Dear Michael, every time your record's on

Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me."



She wrote "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter
She wrote "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter

Another song: 
Oh so, your wounds they show
I know you have never felt so alone
But hold on, head up, be strong
Oh hold on, hold on until you hear them come
Here they come, oh
